# Project for CS190D - Music Synthesis with Allolib(in C++)
## Project 1 - Melody Design with Sine Envelope Synthesized Piano 
Get familiar with the Allolib playground environment, and use the SineEnv.cpp file to directly play a simple melody from the movie "Howl's Moving Castle" using my keyboard and record it. 
You can find the synthSequence file under **allolibplayground/tutorials/synthesis/bin/SineEnv_Piano-data/merry_go_round.synthSequence**

## Project 2 - Sound design with Extending the Allolib Subtractive Synthesis WorkStation 
Starting from the 08_SubSyn.cpp, I was trying to extend the existing tutorial by adding more sound design option by adding a vibrato term (adjusting "vibratoDepth" and "vibratoRate") 
using the gamma library. Then I add some visual effect with different positions and colors appear on the screen when you press different keys(pitches) on the keyboard.
You can find the file under **allolibplayground/project/subsynth_plus.cpp**

## Final Project - Extending Project 2 and Setting Preset Parameters for Different Sound Effects
The majority of the work is to gather what I have so far and experiment what I can get from these parameters and try to find patterns within similar instruments.
As a results, I made sound effects on percussion instruments(Kick Drum, Hi Hat), wind instruments(Trombone, Flute, String with vibrato), pad instruments (with vibrato),
natural sounds(oceanwave) and more creative noisy sounds(space travel, laser gun).
A more details explanation of the parameters can be found here:
